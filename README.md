# PizzaStore

## This is a PizzaStore project that has been built using the abstract factory design pattern.

This project allows by using the ***Abstract Factory Pattern*** allows to order different pizzas based on the pizzaStore location, and get all the sets of pizzas that are in the store.


The *Abstract Factory Pattern* allows to get a set of families of products in a decoupled way, where the client does not know which product is getting, but it know which interface methods are being implemented.

This also separates the factories from the products, so you can just get the product you want by entering it, into the right factory.

> This is just a project to show the ***Abstract Factory Design Pattern***, therefore the whole functionality has not been implemented.
